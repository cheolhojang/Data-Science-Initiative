# Data-Science-Initiative
A big part of my Ethnic Studies course was a community project that everyone was required to complete. There were different types of projects, such as writing a Wikipedia post, volunteering and meeting different coalition groups, as well as my choice, which was to gather data using numpy and create a presentation for the class basically talking about what we found. We were sectioned off into groups after 2 weeks of the semester to start our work. I was in charge of the coding aspect. I gathered the data my partners found and started finding ways to display them. 

Our project was based on the recent immigration controversy. We wanted to know where immigrants, legal and nonlegal, were looking for help, as well as where they were employed and if they weren't, where were they moving for employment. 
Disclaimer: Only a small fraction of my research was presented on the last day of class because of time constraints.
